# CodeKata [TDD with Behat and PhpSpec] 
This repository provides initial composer dependencies and file structure
 which I use for TDD Code Kata.

To start your own kata just run:

```
composer install
``` 

Then you can start with writing behat features or dive directly into describing with PhpSpec how your objects should behave
